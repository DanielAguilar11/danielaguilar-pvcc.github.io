        <td colspan="3"> Sometimes it is necessary to connect existing networks to form an extended communication system. T
            his can be done by connecting the networks to form a larger
            version of the same “type” of network. This is done by means of different devices known as repeaters,
            bridges, and switches, the distinctions of which are subtle yet informative. The
            simplest of these is the repeater, which is little more than a device that passes
            signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form
            of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals. </td>

        <td> Bridge </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> A bridge is similar to, but more complex than, a repeater. Like a repeater,
            it connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all messages across the
            connection. Instead, it looks at the destination address that accompanies each
            message and forwards a message across the connection only when that message is destined for 
            a computer on the other side. Thus, two machines residing
            on the same side of a bridge can exchange messages without interfering with
            communication taking place on the other side. A bridge produces a more
            efficient system than that produced by a repeater. </td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>  
        <td> Switch </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> A switch is essentially a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to
            connect several buses rather than just two. Thus, a switch produces a network
            consisting of several buses extending from the switch, as spokes on a wheel
            (Figure 4.4b). As in the case of a bridge, a switch considers the destination
            addresses of all messages and forwards only those messages destined for
            other spokes. Moreover, each message that is forwarded is relayed only into
            the appropriate spoke, thus minimizing the traffic in each spoke. </td>

  <tr>   
        <td> Router </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> The connection between networks to form an internet is handled by devices
            known as routers, which are special purpose computers used for forwarding
            messages. Note that the task of a router is different from that of repeaters,
            bridges, and switches in that routers provide links between networks while
            allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics. </td>
  </tr>        
  <tr>
        <td> Gateway </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> The “point” at which one network is linked to an internet is often called
            a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the network and the
            outside world. Gateways can be found in a variety of forms, and thus the term
            is used rather loosely. In many cases, a network's gateway is merely the router
            through which it communicates with the rest of the internet. In other cases,
            the term gateway may be used to refer to more than just a router. For example,
            in most residential WiFi networks that are connected to the Internet, the term
            gateway refers collectively to both the network's AP and the router connected
            to the AP because these two devices are normally packaged in a single unit. </td>

        <td colspan="3"> Today, the client/server model is used extensively in network applications, 
            as we will see later in this chapter. However, the client/server model
            is not the only means of interprocess communication. Another model is
            the peer-to-peer (often abbreviated P2P) model. Whereas the client/server
            model involves one process (the server) providing a service to numerous
            others (clients), the peer-to-peer model involves processes that provide service to and receive 
            service from each other. </td>

        <td> Distributed System </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> With the success of networking technology, interaction between computers
            via networks has become common and multifaceted. Many modern software systems, such as global 
            information retrieval systems, company-wide
            accounting and inventory systems, computer games, and even the software
            that controls a network's infrastructure itself are designed as distributed systems, meaning that 
            they consist of software units that execute as processes
            on different computers. </td>

            whereby huge pools of shared computers on the network can be allocated
            for use by clients as needed, is the latest trend in distributed systems. As
            much as the spread of metropolitan electrical grids in the early twentieth
            century eliminated the need for individual factories and businesses to maintain their own generators, 
            the Internet is making it possible for entities to
            entrust their data and computations to “the Cloud,” which in this case refers
            to the enormous computing resources already available on the network.

            At the top of this hierarchy are relatively few tier-1 ISPs that consist of very
            high-speed, high-capacity, international WANs. These networks are thought of
            as the backbone of the Internet. They are typically operated by large companies

            that most or all of the network remains connected even when very important

        the Internet's operation. The ISPs are then allowed to allocate the addresses within their awarded blocks to
        machines within their region of authority, typically given in smaller, consecutively numbered 
        blocks to client organization. Thus, machines throughout the
        Internet are hierarchically assigned unique IP addresses.

        means of a mnemonic address, the software being used must be able to convert
        that address into an IP address before transmitting the message. This conversion is 
        performed with the aid of numerous servers, called name servers, that
        are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.
        Collectively, these name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system
        known as the domain name system (DNS). The process of using DNS to perform a translation 
        is called a DNS lookup. </td>

            The Internet quickly grew to include countries all over the world, resulting in the creation of new two-letter TLDs
            for each specific country (called country-code TLDs) such as .au for Australia
            and .ca for Canada. In the 21st century, hundreds of new TLDs were added
            to the DNS hierarchy, such as .biz for businesses, or .museum for museums.

            programs that each followed a network protocol. A newsreader application
            contacted servers using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), an
            application for listing and copying files across the network implemented the File Transfer Protocol 
            (FTP), or an application for accessing another computer from a great distance used the Telnet protocol,

            to be handled by webpages via the powerful Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
            (HTTP). Nevertheless, when examining a network protocol for an Internet

            host to the other. Consider the example case of a mail server mail.skaro.gov
            sending an email from end user “dalek” to end user “doctor” in the domain
            tardis.edu. First, a mail handling process on mail.skaro.gov contacts the
            mail server process on mail.tardis.edu. To accomplish this, it uses DNS,
            another network protocol, to map the human-readable destination domain
            name to the proper mail server name, and then to its IP address. This is not
            unlike looking up the phone number of an acquaintance before dialing. Similarly, when the server 
            process at the other end answers, the protocol states that it must identify itself to the caller. </td>

        this point, the packets are treated as individual, unrelated messages until they
        reach the transport layer at their final destination. It is quite possible for the

        <td colspan="3"> It is the network layer's job to decide in which direction a packet should

        combination of the network layer and the link layer below it constitutes the
        software residing on the Internet routers. The network layer is in charge of
        maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine
        the direction in which to forward packets. The link layer at the router is in
        charge of receiving and transmitting the packets.
        Thus, when the network layer at a packet's origin receives the packet
        from the transport layer, it uses its forwarding table to determine where the
        packet should be sent to get it started on its journey. Having determined the
        proper direction, the network layer hands the packet to the link layer for
        actual transmission. </td>

        is an Ethernet, the link layer applies CSMA/CD. If the network is a WiFi
        network, the link layer applies CSMA/CA.
        When a packet is transmitted, it is received by the link layer at the other
        end of the connection. There, the link layer hands the packet up to its network
        layer where the packet's final destination is compared to the network layer's
        forwarding table to determine the direction of the packet's next step. With
        this decision made, the network layer returns the packet to the link layer to
        be forwarded along its way. In this manner, each packet hops from machine
        to machine on its way to its final destination. </td>

            software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack
            include viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the
            primary characteristic of the software. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
        <td> Virus </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> A virus is software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside 
            in the machine. Then, when the “host” program is
            executed, the virus is also executed. When executed, many viruses do little
            more than try to transfer themselves to other programs within the computer.
            Some viruses, however, perform devastating actions such as degrading portions of the operating system, 
            erasing large blocks of mass storage, or otherwise corrupting data and other programs. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
        <td> Worm </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> A worm is an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence 
            in computers and forwarding copies of itself to
            other computers. As in the case of a virus, a worm can be designed merely
            to replicate itself or to perform more extreme vandalism. A characteristic
            consequence of a worm is an explosion of the worm's replicated copies that
            degrades the performance of legitimate applications and can ultimately overload an entire network or internet. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
        <td> Trojan Horse </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> A Trojan horse is a program that enters a computer system disguised as
            a desirable program, such as a game or useful utility package, that is willingly
            imported by the victim. Once in the computer, however, the Trojan horse performs additional activities that 
            might have harmful effects. Sometimes these
            additional activities start immediately. In other instances, the Trojan horse
            might lie dormant until triggered by a specific event such as the occurrence
            of a preselected date. Trojan horses often arrive in the form of attachments
            to enticing email messages. When the attachment is opened (that is, when
            the recipient asks to view the attachment), the misdeeds of the Trojan horse
            are activated. Thus, email attachments from unknown sources should never
            be opened. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
        <td> Spyware </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> Another form of malicious software is spyware (sometimes called sniffing
            software), which is software that collects information about activities at the
            computer on which it resides and reports that information back to the instigator of the attack. 
            Some companies use spyware as a means of building customer profiles, and in this context, it has 
            questionable ethical merit. In other
            cases, spyware is used for blatantly malicious purposes such as recording the
            symbol sequences typed at the computer's keyboard in search of passwords
            or credit card numbers. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
        <td> Phishing </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> As opposed to obtaining information secretly by sniffing via spyware,
            phishing is a technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking
            for it. The term phishing is a play on the word fishing because the process
            involved is to cast numerous “lines” in hopes that someone will “take the
            bait.” Phishing is often carried out via email, and in this form, it is little more
            than an old telephone con. The perpetrator sends email messages posing as
            a financial institution, a government bureau, or perhaps a law enforcement
            agency. The email asks the potential victim for information that is supposedly
            needed for legitimate purposes. However, the information obtained is used
            by the perpetrator for hostile purposes. </td>

  <tr>
        <td> DDoS Attack </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> A denial of service attack requires the generation of a large number of
            messages in a short period of time in order to overwhelm the targeted server.
            To accomplish this, an attacker usually plants software on numerous unsuspecting computers 
            that will generate messages when a signal is given. Then, when
            the signal is given, all of these computers (sometimes called a botnet) swamp
            the target with messages. When the work of generating the attacks is distributed over many hosts, 
            this is known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS)
            attack. Inherent, then, in distributed denial of service attacks is the availability
            of unsuspecting computers to use as accomplices. This is why all computer users
            are encouraged to install all security updates from their operating system vendor, and to use 
            appropriate protection on any Internet-connected host. It has
            been estimated that once a computer is connected to the Internet, at least one
            intruder will attempt to exploit its existence within 20 minutes. In turn, a poorly
            protected host represents a significant threat to the integrity of the Internet. </td>

  <tr>
        <td rowspan="6"> Protection </td>
        <td> Firewall </td>        
        <td colspan="3"> The old adage “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” is certainly
            true in the context of controlling vandalism over network connections. A primary prevention 
            technique is to filter traffic passing through a point in the network, usually with a program called a 
            firewall. For instance, a firewall might be
            installed at the gateway of an organization's intranet to filter messages passing
            in and out of the region. Such firewalls might be designed to block outgoing
            messages with certain destination addresses or to block incoming messages
            from origins that are known to be sources of trouble. This latter function is a
            tool for terminating a denial of service attack because it provides a means of
            blocking traffic from the attacking computers. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
        <td> Spam Filter </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> Some variations of firewalls are designed for specific purposes—an example being 
            spam filters, which are firewalls designed to block unwanted email.
            Many spam filters use rather sophisticated techniques to distinguish between
            desirable email and spam. Some learn to make this distinction via a training
            process in which the user identifies items of spam until the filter acquires
            enough examples to make decisions on its own. These filters are examples of
            how a variety of subject areas (probability theory, artificial intelligence, etc.)
            can jointly contribute to developments in other fields. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
        <td> Proxy Server </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> Another preventative tool that has filtering connotations is the proxy
            server. A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a
            client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of
            the server. Without a proxy server, a client communicates directly with a server,
            meaning that the server has an opportunity to learn a certain amount about
            the client. Over time, as many clients within an organization's intranet deal
            with a distant server, that server can collect a multitude of information about
            the intranet's internal structure—information that can later be used for malicious activity. 
            To counter this, an organization can establish a proxy server for
            a particular kind of service (FTP, HTTP, etc.). </td>

  <tr>
        <td> Antivirus Software </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> Another means of defense against invasions via network connections is
            software called antivirus software, which is used to detect and remove the
            presence of known viruses and other infections. (Actually, antivirus software
            represents a broad class of software products, each designed to detect and
            remove a specific type of infection. For example, whereas many products specialize in 
            virus control, others specialize in spyware protection.) It is important for users of these packages to 
            understand that, just as in the case of
            biological systems, new computer infections are constantly coming on the
            scene that require updated vaccines. Thus, antivirus software must be routinely maintained by downloading 
            updates from the software's vendor.  </td>

        <td> Cryptography </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> In some cases, the purpose of network vandalism is to disrupt the system (as
            in denial of service attacks), but in other cases, the ultimate goal is to gain
            access to information. The traditional means of protecting information is to
            control its access through the use of passwords. However, passwords can be
            compromised and are of little value when data are transferred over networks
            and internets where messages are relayed by unknown entities. Cryptography is the study 
            of sending and receiving messages securely in the presence
            of adversaries. </td>

  <tr>
        <td> Public Key Encryption </td>          
        <td colspan="3"> Cryptographic tools such as encryption can be used to transform a message 
            into a coded version such that even if the encrypted data fall
            into unscrupulous hands, the encoded information will remain confidential.
            Today, many traditional Internet applications have been altered to incorporate cryptographic 
            techniques, producing what are called “secure versions”
            of the applications. </td>
