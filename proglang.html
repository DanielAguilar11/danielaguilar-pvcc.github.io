        <td> Interpreter </td>
        <td colspan="5"> An interpreter is a program that directly executes the instructions

        <td> Machine Independence </td>
        <td colspan="5"> A term applied to software that is not dependent on the properties of a particular 
            machine, and can therefore be used on any machine. Such software is also described as portable. </td>

    <tr>
        <td> High-Level Programming Language </td>
        <td colspan="5"> Examples of high-level programming languages in active use today include Python,

        <td> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) </td>
        <td colspan="5"> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design 
            around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has 
            unique attributes and behavior. </td>

    <tr>
        <td> Scripting Language </td>
        <td colspan="5"> Scripting languages are a specific kind of computer languages that you can use to give instructions 
            to other software, such as a web browser, server, or standalone application. Many of today's most popular coding 
            languages are scripting languages, such as JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and Python. </td>

        <td> Function </td>
        <td colspan="5"> Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually 
            "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. </td>

    <tr>
        <td> Local Variable </td>
        <td colspan="5"> A local variable is declared within one specific sub-program of a larger main program. During the 
            execution of this sub-program, the values of local variables will be held in RAM. Upon completion of the execution of this 
            sub-program the variable is no longer retained in RAM. </td>

    <tr>
        <td> Global Variable </td>
        <td colspan="5"> A global variable is a variable that is declared outside any function and is accessible to all routines 
            in our program. So, its scope is global: it's initialized when we run our software and lasts while the program is running. </td>

        <td> Source Program </td>
        <td colspan="5"> A source program is a text file that contains instructions written in a high level language. It can not
