    <h2>All about GitHub</h2>

    <ul>
        <h3>What is GitHub and how does it work?</h3>

        <li>GitHub is the home for all developers—a platform where you can share code, contribute to open 
            source projects, or even automate your workflow with tools like GitHub Actions and Packages. 
            If you're just getting started with GitHub, you may know us best as a place for version control 
            and collaboration.</li>
        
        <h3>How do I see GitHub's availability?</h3>

        <li><a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/"> Check our real-time status report </a></li>

        <h3>Why is GitHub so popular?</h3>

        <li>GitHub is built by developers for developers, and we're proud to be home to the world's 
            largest open source community. With 50 million developers and millions more open source 
            projects, GitHub has become the go-to place to collaborate and build software together.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/about/milestones"> See how we got here </a></li>
        
        <h3>Who is GitHub for?</h3>

        <li>You! And it's not just developers who build on GitHub—Fortune 500 companies, small teams, 
            project managers, and college professors all use GitHub to do their best work, in one place.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/readme"> Meet our community </a></li>

        <h3>Do people use GitHub only for code?</h3>

        <li>Nope. Like we mentioned above, different people and teams use GitHub for different projects. 
            While we got our start as a version control platform, GitHub is now used to manage teams, 
            share resumes, find new projects, track work, and host discussions, just to name a few.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/explore"> Explore what people are building on GitHub </a></li>

        <h3>Why should I use GitHub?</h3>

        <li>GitHub isn't just a place to share code. It's a chance to do something bigger. On GitHub, 
            you can shape the future of software, work with the best developers in the world, and grow 
            your skills and help others.</li>

        <h3>Are Git and GitHub the same?</h3>

        <li>Git is a version control system (VCS). GitHub is the platform where Git repositories 
            can be hosted and teams can work on them together.</li>
        <li><a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/"> Check out the Git Handbook </a></li>

        <h3>Do I need Git in order to use GitHub?</h3>

        <li>Nope. GitHub repositories can be accessed from both Git and Subversion (SVN) clients.</li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/support-for-subversion-clients"> 
            Learn more about support for Subversion clients </a></li>
        
        <h3>Is GitHub safe?</h3>

        <li>Millions of teams trust GitHub to keep their work safe. While security incidents can 
            happen, our GitHub Security Team goes beyond industry standards to keep you and your code secure.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/security"> Stay up to date on our security process </a></li>

        <h3>Is GitHub free?</h3>

        <li>All GitHub users and teams get free, unlimited access to public and private 
            repositories. But if you're looking for more collaboration features, security controls, 
            and deployment options, we also offer paid plans: GitHub Pro, GitHub Team at $4 per user/month, 
            and GitHub Enterprise at $21 per user/month.</li>

        <h3>Is GitHub owned by Microsoft?</h3>

        <li>Yes. Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018.</li>
        <li>You can read more about it in <a href="https://github.blog/2018-10-26-github-and-microsoft/"> our announcement here </a></li>
